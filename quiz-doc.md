A simple Javascript test submitted with a Chatbot ðŸ¤“

You can use this chatbot to submit a simple test to your audience.

This test makes wide use of "attributes" and "conditions" (aka the "flow").

We also created a rule to proactively engage your visitors to open and complete the test.

We also used "forms" to ask your visitor's data.

It also works on Whatsapp!

Feel free to import and modify this test as you prefer.
