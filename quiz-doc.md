A simple quiz about Javascript submitted through a Chatbot 🤓

You can use this chatbot to submit a simple test to your audience.

This test makes wide use of "attributes" and "conditions" (aka the "flow").

## Design

The test makes wide use of attributes. Attributes are a great way to manage your chatbot flow, and they are especially useful to store some in-flow data using it later to manage your flow with conditions (you can use your attributes in other actions too).

## Proactive rules

We also created a rule to proactively engage your visitors to open and complete the test.

We also used "forms" to ask your visitor's data.

It also works on Whatsapp!

Feel free to import and modify this test as you prefer.
