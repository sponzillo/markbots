A simple quiz about Javascript submitted through a Chatbot ü§ì

You can use this chatbot to submit a simple test to your audience.

This test makes wide use of "attributes" and "conditions" (aka the "flow").

## Quiz Design

The test makes wide use of attributes. Attributes are a great way to manage your chatbot flow, and they are especially useful to store some in-flow data that can be also used later to manage your flow with conditions (you can use your attributes in other actions too).

The test starts with the ‚ÄúStart quiz‚Äù button in the ‚Äústart‚Äù block. Set up the ‚Äútotal‚Äù attribute to his initial value of zero when the button is pressed.
**TIP**: Button‚Äôs ‚ÄúAttributes‚Äù option allows you to set up as many attributes as you want on a single button pressure.

The first question simply proposes four possible replies (plus a "Cancel test" option), where only one is true.

We always use the Button's Attributes feature to set the current test score. Every time the user pressed the correct reply's botton the total score increases of the corresponding amount. When an incorrect reply is selected the score is set to zero.

Now move to question2. From now on, until the last question, each question will have the same identical structure.
On each question we simply increase the "total" score adding the current reply's score coming from the previuos button press.

## Proactive rules

We also created a rule to proactively engage your visitors to open and complete the test.

We also used "forms" to ask your visitor's data.

It also works on Whatsapp!
